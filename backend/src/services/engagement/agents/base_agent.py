"""
BaseAgent — abstract interface all engagement agents must implement.

Each agent:
  - Receives a curated engagement_context dict (from DecisionEngine)
  - Calls ModelProvider with a specialized prompt
  - Returns NotificationOutput

Adding a new agent:
  1. Create a subclass here (or in a new file in this package)
  2. Implement generate()
  3. Add one property to AgentRegistry + one entry in get_specialist()
